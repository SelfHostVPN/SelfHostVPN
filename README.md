# Self Hosted VPN Gateway

This is a script for a server on which you want to set up your own VPN server. This offers all the functions that are also available from the large VPN providers.

Other add-ons include some useful functions such as an ad blocker, proxy server, internal network (for gaming and file sharing) and a self-hosted chat to communicate securely with others.
